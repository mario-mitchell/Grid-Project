                <p class="description">The D.A., or Dumbledore’s Army, was a group of students who were trained by Harry Potter in magical combat during the 1995-1996 school year at Hogwarts. The D.A. fought in several battles against the Death Eaters and suffered casualties. The group loosely reformed during the 1997-1998 school year, led by Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley, as a resistance against the regime of Severus Snape and the Carrows at Hogwarts. More commonly referred to as the D.A., the name of the organization was chosen by Ginny Weasley to go with the initials (suggested by Cho Chang as an acronym for another possible name). The name “Dumbledore’s Army” was selected because it signified the worst fear of certain high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Magic at the time.</p>

                <p class="description">Lord Voldemort, born Tom Marvolo Riddle, was the son of Merope Gaunt (a descendent of Salazar Slytherin) and Tom Riddle, a handsome, wealthy Muggle from Little Hangleton whom Merope ensnared with a love potion. When her husband found out she was a witch, he abandoned her while she was pregnant. Tom’s mother died shortly after giving birth to him one December 31, living just long enough to name him Tom Riddle, after his father and Marvolo, after his grandfather.</p>

Considered to be the most powerful wizard of his time, Dumbledore was awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class, and was the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards as well as the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.</p>
